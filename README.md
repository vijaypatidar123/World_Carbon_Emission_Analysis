# CO₂ Emission Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing CO₂ emissions data to understand trends, key contributors, and correlations with factors such as economic growth, energy use, and industrial activities. The analysis is presented using Python and Jupyter Notebook for clear visualization and interpretability of results.

 
## Requirements

- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - numpy
 

## Results

The notebook provides interactive and static visualizations along with insights derived from the data, helping understand:
- Global CO₂ emission trends over time
- Regional contributions to CO₂ emissions
- Possible relationships between CO₂ emissions and economic/industrial factors
